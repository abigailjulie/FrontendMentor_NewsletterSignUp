## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I gained more practice with JavaScript and using the DOM to update UI when an event listener occurs. Started using :root for better readability and consistency.

### Continued development

If I were to do a project like this again I would create two pages that you would navigate between rather than hiding and showing certain attributes.

### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap Forms](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/forms/overview/#overview) - This helped me create the email input form.
- [Unicode Charactors](https://unicodes.jessetane.com/) - This is where I found the chechmark.
